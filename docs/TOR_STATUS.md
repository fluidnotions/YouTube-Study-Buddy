# Tor Setup Status Report

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Tor Installation**: Locally installed and running on `127.0.0.1:9050`
2. **Control Port**: Configured on port `9051` with cookie authentication
3. **Circuit Rotation**: Successfully rotating Tor circuits (confirmed with `‚úì Tor circuit rotated` messages)
4. **Group Permissions**: User added to `debian-tor` group for authcookie access

## ‚ùå Current Problem

**YouTube is blocking ALL Tor exit nodes**, even after circuit rotation. Error message:
```
YouTube is blocking requests from your IP. This usually is due to one of the following reasons:
- You have done too many requests and your IP has been blocked by YouTube
- You are doing requests from an IP belonging to a cloud provider
```

## üîç Evidence

### Circuit Rotation Working
```bash
# Without group permissions (OLD):
Warning: Could not rotate Tor circuit: Authentication failed: unable to read '/run/tor/control.authcookie'
Circuit rotation unavailable, adding 10s delay...

# With group permissions (NOW):
‚úì Tor circuit rotated
```

### YouTube Still Blocking
Even with working circuit rotation, all 5 retry attempts fail with the same IP blocking error.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Tests

**IMPORTANT**: You must run commands within the `debian-tor` group context:

```bash
# Run tests with Tor permissions
sg debian-tor -c "uv run pytest -v"

# Run simple transcript test
sg debian-tor -c "uv run python test_simple.py"

# Run any command with Tor access
sg debian-tor -c "uv run <your-command>"
```

**Why?** The current shell session doesn't have `debian-tor` group active. You need to either:
1. Log out and log back in (permanent)
2. Use `sg debian-tor -c "command"` (per-command)
3. Use `newgrp debian-tor` (switches current session)

## üìã Configuration Summary

- **Tor Host**: `127.0.0.1`
- **Tor Port**: `9050` (SOCKS proxy)
- **Control Port**: `9051`
- **Authentication**: Cookie-based (`/run/tor/control.authcookie`)
- **User Group**: `debian-tor`

## ü§î Next Steps

The circuit rotation is working, but YouTube's blanket blocking of Tor exit nodes is the bottleneck. Possible solutions:

1. **Use Tor bridges**: Configure Tor to use bridge relays instead of public exit nodes
2. **Residential proxy**: Use a residential proxy service instead of Tor
3. **Rate limiting**: Add significant delays between requests (may not work if IPs are blocklisted)
4. **yt-dlp fallback**: Some users report better success with yt-dlp for transcript extraction
5. **Accept limitations**: Document that some videos may be inaccessible via Tor

## üìù Setup Scripts

Two scripts are available in the project root:
- `setup_tor_control.sh` - Interactive setup with explanations
- `setup_tor_control_auto.sh` - Non-interactive auto-setup

Both configure:
- Tor control port (9051)
- Cookie authentication
- Group permissions (debian-tor)
- Service restart
