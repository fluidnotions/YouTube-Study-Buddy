# Deep Learning Fundamentals

## What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to learn hierarchical representations of data. The "deep" refers to the number of layers in the network.

## Core Architecture Patterns

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs are specialized for processing grid-like data such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
RNNs process sequential data by maintaining hidden states that capture information from previous time steps. They're essential for time series and natural language tasks.

### Transformers
Modern transformer architectures use self-attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel, revolutionizing NLP and beyond.

## Training Deep Networks

### Gradient Descent Variants
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Updates weights using single examples
- **Mini-batch GD**: Balances computation and convergence
- **Adam Optimizer**: Adaptive learning rates for each parameter

### Regularization Techniques
To prevent overfitting, we use dropout, batch normalization, and L2 regularization. These techniques help models generalize better to unseen data.

## Challenges
Deep networks require large datasets, significant computational resources, and careful hyperparameter tuning. Vanishing gradients can occur in very deep architectures.
