# Machine Learning Basics

## Introduction
Machine learning enables computers to learn patterns from data without explicit programming. It's a fundamental approach in artificial intelligence.

## Types of Learning

### Supervised Learning
Models learn from labeled examples, mapping inputs to known outputs. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

### Unsupervised Learning
Algorithms find hidden patterns in unlabeled data through clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

### Reinforcement Learning
Agents learn optimal behaviors through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for actions in an environment.

## Model Evaluation

### Training vs Testing
We split data into training and testing sets to evaluate how well models generalize to new examples. Cross-validation provides more robust performance estimates.

### Metrics
- **Classification**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- **Regression**: MSE, RMSE, R-squared, MAE

### Overfitting and Underfitting
Overfitting occurs when models memorize training data instead of learning generalizable patterns. Underfitting happens when models are too simple to capture underlying relationships.

## Feature Engineering
Selecting, transforming, and creating relevant features is crucial for model performance. Domain knowledge helps identify meaningful representations.
