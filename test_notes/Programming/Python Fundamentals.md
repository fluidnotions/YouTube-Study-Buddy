# Python Fundamentals

## Overview
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It's widely used in web development, data science, automation, and artificial intelligence.

## Core Concepts

### Data Types and Structures
Python provides built-in types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Collections include lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

### Functions and Scope
Functions encapsulate reusable code blocks. Python supports first-class functions, closures, and decorators for powerful abstractions.

### Object-Oriented Programming
Classes define blueprints for objects with attributes and methods. Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation enable modular design.

## Important Features

### List Comprehensions
Concise syntax for creating lists: `[x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]`

### Context Managers
The `with` statement ensures proper resource management, automatically handling setup and teardown.

### Generators and Iterators
Generators yield values lazily, enabling memory-efficient processing of large datasets.

## Best Practices
Follow PEP 8 style guidelines, write docstrings, use type hints, and leverage virtual environments for dependency isolation.
