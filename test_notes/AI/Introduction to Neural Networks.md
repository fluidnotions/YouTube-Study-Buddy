# Introduction to Neural Networks

## Overview
Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural systems. They form the foundation of modern deep learning and artificial intelligence.

## Key Concepts

### Artificial Neurons
An artificial neuron receives inputs, applies weights, adds a bias term, and passes the result through an activation function. This mimics how biological neurons process signals.

### Layers and Architecture
Neural networks consist of multiple layers:
- **Input layer**: Receives raw data
- **Hidden layers**: Process and transform information
- **Output layer**: Produces final predictions

### Learning Process
Networks learn through backpropagation, adjusting weights based on the error between predicted and actual outputs. This optimization process uses gradient descent algorithms.

## Applications
Neural networks excel at pattern recognition, computer vision, natural language processing, and complex decision-making tasks.

## Mathematical Foundation
The forward pass computation involves matrix multiplication and activation functions. Each layer transforms its input: `output = activation(weights Ã— input + bias)`
