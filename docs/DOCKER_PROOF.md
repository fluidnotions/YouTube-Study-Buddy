# Docker Setup - Verified Working

## Proof of Working Container

### Container Status (Verified Oct 9, 2025)

```bash
$ docker ps --filter "name=youtube-study-buddy"
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    STATUS                    PORTS
9d61918a062e   youtube-study-buddy      Up 50 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:8501->8501/tcp
```

**Status**: ✅ Running and healthy
**Image**: `youtube-study-buddy` (built from `Dockerfile`)
**Tor**: ✅ Working (Real IP: 169.1.137.134 → Tor Exit: 109.70.100.2)
**Streamlit**: ✅ Responding on http://localhost:8501
**Health Check**: ✅ Passing

### What's Actually Running

The container uses:
- **Dockerfile**: Single `Dockerfile` in project root (Python 3.13 + Tor)
- **Entrypoint**: `entrypoint-python-tor.sh`
- **Compose File**: `docker-compose.yml`

==========================================
YouTube Study Buddy with Tor
==========================================
Starting Tor...
Tor started with PID: 8
Bootstrapped 100% (done): Done
✓ Tor is ready!

Testing Tor connection...
Real IP:     169.1.137.134
Tor exit IP: 109.70.100.2
✓ Tor is working correctly (different IPs)

✓ Tor control port accessible for circuit rotation

Starting YouTube Study Buddy...
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
URL: http://0.0.0.0:8501
```

### Streamlit Verification

```bash
$ curl -s http://localhost:8501 | head -20
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    ...Streamlit HTML...
```

**Result**: Streamlit is serving HTML correctly ✅

## How to Use

### Simple Commands

  --name youtube-study-buddy \
  -p 8501:8501 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v $(pwd)/notes:/app/notes \
  youtube-study-buddy

# Or use docker-compose
docker compose up -d

# Or use convenience script
./run-docker.sh
```

## File Structure (Cleaned Up)

```
Project Root:
  Dockerfile                      ← Main Dockerfile (Python + Tor)
  docker-compose.yml              ← Main compose file
  entrypoint-python-tor.sh        ← Container startup script
  run-docker.sh                   ← Convenience script

  Dockerfile.old-without-tor      ← Old version (backup)
  docker-compose.yml.old          ← Old version (backup)

  docs/                           ← Documentation
    BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md
    QUICKSTART.md
    SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md
    TOR_STATUS.md
    TOR_SETUP.md

  scripts/                        ← Development helpers
    setup_tor_control.sh          (for local dev only)
    test_simple.py                (for testing)
    README.md                     (explains what scripts do)
```

## Why Multiple Dockerfiles Were There

During development, I tried several approaches:
1. `Dockerfile` - Original without Tor integration
2. `Dockerfile.python-tor` - Python base + Tor (this worked!)
3. `Dockerfile.torproxy` - Alpine torproxy base + Python (failed - too complex)
4. `Dockerfile.torproxy-simple` - Simplified Alpine version (failed - old Python)

**Cleanup**: The working `Dockerfile.python-tor` is now renamed to `Dockerfile`. Failed attempts deleted. Old working version backed up as `Dockerfile.old-without-tor`.

## No Speculation - This Actually Works

The container has been:
- ✅ Built successfully
- ✅ Started and running for 50+ minutes
- ✅ Health check passing
- ✅ Tor confirmed working (different IPs)
- ✅ Streamlit confirmed serving HTML
- ✅ Circuit rotation confirmed accessible

This is not speculation - the container is currently running and verified working.
